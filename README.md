## Hardware setup

This example requires minor hardware modifications in default BSP based on the test modes supported. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

Three analog peripherals are tested in this code example and the hardware modifications for each are as follows:

1. ADC test: The ADC is tested against two reference voltages i.e., VDD/3 and 2VDD/3. In the default configuration, connect VDDA/3 to the pin that is configured as an analog pin. To test for 2VDD/3, enable the `ADC_REF_VOLTAGE2` macro in the *self_test.h* file and connect 2VDDA/3 to the analog pin.

2. Comparator test: Connect a lower voltage to the positive input of the LPCOMP i.e., to the `CYBSP_DUT_LPCOMP_VPLUS_PIN` pin.

3. Opamp test: The opamp is tested against two reference voltages i.e., VDD/3 and 2VDD/3. In the default configuration, connect VDDA/3 to the pin that is configured as the Vplus input pin. To test for (2VDD/3), enable the `ADC_REF_VOLTAGE2` macro in the *self_test.h* file and connect 2VDDA/3 to the Vplus input pin.

> **Note:** The PSoC&trade; 6 Bluetooth&reg; LE Pioneer Kit (CY8CKIT-062-BLE) and the PSoC&trade; 6 Wi-Fi Bluetooth&reg; Pioneer Kit (CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT) ship with KitProg2 installed. ModusToolbox&trade; requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/Infineon/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".
## Software setup

## Operation

If using a PSoC&trade; 64 "Secure" MCU kit (like CY8CKIT-064B0S2-4343W), the PSoC&trade; 64 device must be provisioned with keys and policies before being programmed. Follow the instructions in the ["Secure Boot" SDK user guide](https://www.infineon.com/dgdlac/Infineon-PSoC_64_Secure_MCU_Secure_Boot_SDK_User_Guide-Software-v07_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7d0d8da4017d0f8c361a7666) to provision the device. If the kit is already provisioned, copy-paste the keys and policy folder to the application folder.
1. Connect the pins of the kit using the instructions as described in the [Hardware setup](#hardware-setup) section.

2. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

3. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

4. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>In other IDEs</b></summary>

   Follow the instructions in your preferred IDE.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

4. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that **Class-B safety test: Analog peripheral** is displayed on the UART terminal along with the available commands.

   **Figure 1. Terminal output on program startup**

   ![](images/terminal-analog-test.png)


5. To run the self-test commands, enter the following: 
      - **1:** For ADC peripheral
      - **2:** For comparator
      - **3:** For opamp

> **Note:** Comparator is not supported by XMC7000 MCUs. Opamp is supported only by `CY8CKIT-062S4` kit and the kits wih 1M flash memory.

6. Based on the commands entered in the previous step, the serial terminal displays the result of the tests performed on the respective peripheral.


## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code.


<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

Use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

> **Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice – once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.infineon.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.

## Design and implementation

The example demonstrates an analog test for three key analog peripherals: comparator, opamp, and ADC in the PSoC&trade; 6 and XMC7000 MCUs. It utilizes the Class-B Safety Test Library to execute these tests. See the [Hardware setup](#hardware-setup) section for detailed connection instructions.

The example starts by initializing the BSP configuration according to the design configurations and setting up the retarget-io for debug prints. The CPU then waits for the commands entered from the serial terminal. When it is received, the code parses the commands that have been sent:

   - **Command `1` - ADC test**:
     - This test focuses on the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and offers flexibility in choosing between internal and external voltage references.
     - By measuring the voltage on a specific channel and comparing it against the expected result within a defined accuracy range, this test validates the accuracy and functionality of the ADC in converting analog signals to digital values.

   - **Command `2` - Comparator test**:
     - This test focuses on the analog comparator. It connects the comparator to GPIO pins, allowing selection of two voltage references on AMUXBUS A and AMUXBUS B.
     - The test verifies if the comparator output aligns with the expected result. A non-zero value indicates that the positive input voltage is anticipated to be greater than the negative input voltage.

   - **Command `3` - Opamp test**:
     - The opamp test examines the operational amplifier functionality. It connects the opamp to the ADC and utilizes GPIO pins as a multiplexer to choose various voltage references on AMUXBUS A and AMUXBUS B.
     - By comparing the measured voltage against the anticipated outcome within a defined accuracy range, this test ensures that the opamp operates correctly and generates the expected output voltage.

The XMC7000 MCUs does not have a comparator block and it does not support self-test for comparator. Only `CY8CKIT-062S4` kit and the kits wih 1M flash memory, out of all the supported kits mentioned in the [Supported kits](#supported-kits-make-variable-target) section, has opamp IP. Therefore, opamp is supported only by `CY8CKIT-062S4` kit and the kits wih 1M flash memory.

This example utilizes the analog block of the PSoC&trade; 6 and XMC7000 MCUs to conduct comprehensive testing. The custom *design.modus* file with minimal configuration changes is shipped with the code example for the respective kits. 

By executing these tests, the example ensures the proper functioning of the analog peripheral, providing valuable insights into the performance and reliability of the PSoC&trade; 6 and XMC7000 MCUs. The test results are displayed on the console, facilitating easy evaluation and troubleshooting.
